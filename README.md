# VQA Web-App

This project is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) web application that allows users to upload images and ask questions about them. The backend uses a deep learning model trained to understand and answer questions based on the image content.

This project is part of my larger Visual Question Answering system that I have worked on. You can find the full VQA  project here:
